# Scope Hunter 1.5.0

## Changes
- Tooltips are less verbose
- Tooltips are more compact
- Tooltips now generate images for color boxes
- CSS changes to tooltips
- Better control of tooltip content
- Dividers between multiselect scopes
- Added messages.

## Important!
Tooltips now only work on **3072**.  There were some changes in the Sublime API that Scope Hunter is now taking advantage of, so if you want tooltips to still look good, please upgrade Sublime to 3072 or disable tooltips.
